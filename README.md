# Maze
This program guides a robot through a maze. The robot can solve variations of the maze too as long as the starting and ending point for it are the same. The robot is represented by an arrow. Please note that to run this program, you need to add the becker.jar file to the classpath of the project (the project uses methods and classes from that jar file).
